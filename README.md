What drew me to this art piece was the [article I first found about it](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17761424/ai-algorithm-art-machine-vision-perception-tom-white-treachery-imagenet), written by James Vincent. It connected Tom White's pieces, created with neural networks, to [René Magritte's painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images). I first found out about this painting in English class in high school, and since have had a liking for the study of semiotics and meaning in abstract or uncommonly known forms. Tom White's piece reminds me very much of what I've learned so far about semiotics. This is not so much an interactive piece, but White does explain his process in creating it. In addition to putting constraints on the drawing system, he also had expressive goals, and a planning system he iterated through to achieve what he wanted in the artwork.

No Man's Sky is a video game where most, if not all, of the environments, as the creators put it, are "procedurally generated". I was drawn to this because I love video games and am currently creating one myself, so I am drawn to the intersections between video games and other forms of art and technology. I also love open world games for their possibility and exploration opportunities, so a project like this caught my eye. The game allows both single- and multiplayer opportunties for building, exploring, and community expansion on generated planets and galaxy in a new-looking universe.
